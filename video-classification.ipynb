When the first element is True, it indicates the video stream contains a frame to read. \n\nIf there is a frame to read, you can then use **imshow()** to display the current frame in a window, otherwise exit the loop. \n\n**video_reader.release()**\n\nWhen you call video_reader.release(), then:\n* release software resource\n* release hardware resource\n\n**cv2.putText(image, text, org, font, fontScale, color[,  thickness [, lineType [, bottomLeftOrigin ] ] ] )**\n\nParameters:\n* image : It is the image on which text is to be drawn.\n* text : Text string to be drawn.\n* org : It is the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the text string in the image. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value).\n* font : It denotes the font type. Some of font types are FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN, , etc.\n* fontScale : Font scale factor that is multiplied by the font-specific base size.\n* color : It is the color of text string to be drawn. For BGR, we pass a tuple. eg: (255, 0, 0) for blue color.\n* thickness : It is the thickness of the line in px.\n* lineType : This is an optional parameter.It gives the type of the line to be used.\n* bottomLeftOrigin : This is an optional parameter.
